박병희 기자] 간송미술관이 5년 만에 다시 일반에 문을 연다.전인건 간송미술관 관장은 3일 서울 동대문디자인플라자(DDP)에서 열린 '삼일운동 100주년 간송특별전, 대한콜렉션' 기자간담회에서 이르면 올가을, 늦어도 내년 봄쯤 다시 성북동에서 관람객을 맞이할 계획이라고 했다.서울 성북구 성북동에 소재한 간송미술관은 사업가 간송 전형필(1906∼1962)이 1938년 보화각이라는 이름으로 세운 우리나라 최초 사립미술관이다. 간송이 일제강점기 전 재산을 쏟아부어 지켜낸 최정상급 문화재들이 소장돼 있으며 호림박물관ㆍ호암미술관과 함께 국내 3대 사립박물관으로 꼽힌다.간송미술관으로 이름을 바꾼 박물관은 1971년부터 한 해 두 차례 기획전을 열었다. 그러다 성북동 미술관 문을 닫고 2014년 3월 개관한 DDP에서 5년간 외부기획전 형태로 소장품을 선보였다. 간송미술관은 4일 DDP에서 개막하는 '삼일운동 100주년 간송특별전, 대한콜렉션'전을 마친 후 다시 간송미술관에서 전시를 시작할 계획이다. 한편 간송미술문화재단과 서울디자인재단이 공동주최하는 '삼일운동 100주년 간송특별展, 대한콜랙숀'에서는 국보 여섯 점과 보물 여덟 점 등 총 60여점의 작품이 선보인다. 간송이 1935년 일본인 골동상 마에다 사이이치로에게서 당시 서울 기와집 10채를 살 수 있는 금액인 2만원에 구입한 국보 제68호 청자상감운학문매병과 간송이 경성미술구락부에서 구입한 국보 제294호 백자청화철채동채초충난국문병 등을 만날 수 있다.박병희 기자 nut@asiae.co.kr▶ 네이버 홈에서 '아시아경제' 뉴스 확인하기▶ 재미와 신기

8월 제주도에서 촬영된 페르세우스 유성우. 사진=한국천문연구원 제공기해년 새해 첫 유성우가 4일 밤 하늘을 수놓는다.지난달 20일 한국천문연구원이 발표한 ‘2019년도 주목할 천문현상 및 1월 6일 부분일식 예보’에 따르면, 4일과 5일 새벽 ‘3대 유성우’라 불리는 사분의자리 유성우를 볼 수 있다. 유성우는 유성(별똥별)이 소나기처럼 많이 쏟아지는 현상을 말한다.또 다른 ‘3대 유성우’인 페르세우스자리 유성우는 오는 8월 13일에, 쌍둥이자리 유성우는 12월 14일과 15일 새벽에 관측할 수 있다.한국천문연구원 관계자는 4일 동아닷컴에 “유성우를 관측할 수 있는 시간대를 정확히 예측하기는 어렵다. 다만 유성우를 관측하려면 어두워져야 해서 4일 밤부터 5일 새벽 사이에 관측할 수 있을 것으로 보인다”고 설명했다.유성우를 제대로 보기 위해서는 높은 건물이 있는 도시보다는 인공조명이 없는 어두운 하늘에서 감상하는 것이 좋다. 도시 불빛에서 벗어나 깜깜하고 맑은 밤하늘이 있는 곳이 좋으며, 주위에 높은 건물과 산이 없어 사방이 트인 곳이 명당으로 꼽힌다.또한 6일에는 달이 해의 일부를 가리는 부분일식을 볼 수 있다. 부분일식은 서울 기준 오전 8시 36분에 시작한다. 오전 9시 45분에 달이 해를 최대로 가리며, 11시 3분에 달이 해와 완전히 떨어져 부분일식 현상이 마무리된다.오는 7월 3일에는 개기일식 현상이 나타나지만, 우리나라에서는 볼 수 없고 남태평양, 남아메리카 지역에서만 관측할 수 있다. 우리나라에서 볼 수 있는 다음 개기일식은 2035년 9월 2일 오전 9시 40분경으로 강원도 일부 지역에서 볼 수 있을 것으로 예상된다. 윤우열 동아닷컴 기자 cloudancer@donga.com▶ 동아일보 단독 / 우아한 : 우리 아이들의 & 아름다운 한반도▶ 동아일보 채널 구독하고 아이패드 받자! 커피는 매주 2000명에게 증정~ⓒ 동아일보 & donga.com, 무단 전재 및 재배포
